            The Faire Ground came first. Claire K. Zada wanted to bring a fantasy world
             to life, as Disney, Orlando, or Renaissance Faires would do. She wanted 
             something that was hers, though. Something new, that could usher in communities 
             to experience exhilarating things that no one else could offer. <br />
              <div> <br /> But how to do that? </div>

          She needed to come up with a history and iconic characters that people would want
           to be a part of and greet. So, Claire K. Zada set out to do just that. She wrote,
            illustrated, and scrapped, and studied. She did all these things to invent a world
             that fantasy lovers could be invested in.  <br />
              <br />  The intent was for the Faire Ground attendees to dress up, or cosplay,
               characters from the stories. To create original designs for themselves and arrive
                in intricate costumes that theyâ€™re proud of. A community for bookworms, nerds, cosplayers, and rennies alike. <br />
                <br />  Claire K. Zada intends to put all her earnings from the
                 New Mune Faire Franchise into savings, so that one day, this Faire Ground may be a reality.
